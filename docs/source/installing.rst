**Installing**
==============

Downloading PyTravCalc
----------------------
Installing and using **PyTravCalc** seems simple enough. Just download the archive from `GitHub
<https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/PyTravCalc>`__ and extract it to a folder you prefer.


Running PyTravCalc
------------------
If you have Python 3.9.4 installed, you can start ``pytravcalc310b.py`` from a CMD prompt or double-click
the Python script.

Alternatively, in the future, if you do not have Python 3.9.4, you can start ``pytravcalc310b.exe`` (located in the
dist folder) from a CMD prompt or by double-clicking the executable program.
